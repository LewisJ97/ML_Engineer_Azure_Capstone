# Machine Learning Engineer with Azure - Capstone Project

This project aimed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. To solve this problem, and combine the learning from the previous two projects from the nanodegree, both Azure's AutoML and HyperDrive functions were utilised to produce machine learning solutions for this tasks. The best model was then deployed using an azure container instance, where sample data could be fed to and a response on new data could be retrieved. 

## Project Set Up and Installation
*OPTIONAL:* If your project has any special installation steps, this is where you should put it. To turn this project into a professional portfolio project, you are encouraged to explain how to set up this project in AzureML.

## Dataset

### Overview
The data used for this task from obtained from Kaggle [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download)

### Task
*TODO*: Explain the task you are going to be solving with this dataset and the features you will be using for it.

### Access
*TODO*: Explain how you are accessing the data in your workspace.


## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.

## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.

## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response

## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
